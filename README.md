Tiny tool to transform Freemind mindmap files into Dendrograms and from there to SVG.

Inspired by @ACevenini, who did this the first time in the hard, manual way.

You can use [WikiMindMap](https://github.com/nyfelix/wikimindmap) to automatically create the mindmap from connected wiki articles.

Dendrogram code by @mbostock from D3.js examples [here](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063570) and [here](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063550).

Thanks!

### Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a  (modern) browser.
2. Drag a Freemind map file (.mm) into the noder browser window.

At this point the map should already render in your browser and you can adjust sizing as needed.
When you're happy with the result, just `Download as SVG`. You can do some "post-production" in Illustrator or other software that can open SVGs.

### Demo

All operations are done locally in your browser, there's no data transmitted to the server.
